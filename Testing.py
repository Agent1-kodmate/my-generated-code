Here is a Python code to print the table of 2:
```
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"2 x {i} = {2 * i}")
```
This code uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10, and for each iteration, it prints the multiplication of 2 with the current number using an f-string.

Output:
```
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
```
